        <h1>Welcome to conrar.com - IT Consulting</h1>
	<h2>Providing tailored IT consulting services to help your business grow and thrive</h2>
        <aside>This website is intentionally sparse and simple..</aside>

        <h2>Why would an IT Consultant have such a boring website?</h2>
        
        <p>Websites are increasingly complex. They take a lot of time to make and aren't very accessible.</p>
	<p>By intentionally using a simple website, you get to the information faster.</p>
	<p>And truthfully, I'm not much of a web designer</p>

	<h2>Here are the things I actually spend time and energy on:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Logical and Physical Networking and Security</li>
            <li>Server Management, Maintenance and Hardening</li>
            <li>Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity</li>
            <li>IT Strategy and Planning</li>
            <li>And many other things, just ask and I will do my best to assist.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Supporting you anywhere in the world, remotely</h3>
        
        <p>And if you happen to be in the Toronto/Kingston corridor; I can assist on site as well</p>
