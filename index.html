        <h2>Why would an IT Consultant have such a boring website?</h2>
        
        <p>Websites are increasingly complex. They take a lot of time to make and aren't very accissible.</p>
	<p>By intentionally using a simple website, you get to the information faster.</p>
	<p>And truthfully, I'm not much of a web designer</p>

	<h3>Here are the things I actually spend time and energy on:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Networking</li>
            <li>2</li>
            <li>3</li>
            <li>4</li>
            <li>5</li>
        </ul>
